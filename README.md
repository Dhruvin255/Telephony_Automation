# Telephony Provider Dashboard Automation

Automating tasks on a telephony provider's dashboard can significantly reduce manual effort and save time. This project aims to automate routine spam checks and replacements of virtual numbers, tasks that typically consume hours of manual work each week. By utilizing Selenium and a webdriver, this script scrapes data off the dashboard and saves it in an Excel file, streamlining the process of addressing spam issues and managing virtual numbers.

## Features

- **Automated Dashboard Interaction**: The script interacts with the telephony provider's dashboard using Selenium, allowing seamless navigation and data extraction.
- **Data Scraping**: Utilizes web scraping techniques to extract relevant information from the dashboard.
- **Excel Export**: Saves scraped data in an Excel file for easy access and analysis.
- **Time Efficiency**: Reduces the time required for routine spam checks and virtual number replacements, optimizing workflow efficiency.
